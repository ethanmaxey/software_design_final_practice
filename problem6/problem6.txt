Using test first development, write the program described below.

Write a program that will read a list of European city names from a file and 
display the number of hours difference between the time at that location and 
GMT time.

The time difference can be found from querying the following URL:

http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Europe/CITYNAME.txt

For example,
http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Europe/Riga.txt
can be used to find the time offset for the city of Riga.

The offset is provided among the response as
raw_offset: 7200

Divide 7200 by 3600 and the result is 2 hours difference.

The program should read a list of city names and for each city print the 
following:

Name of the city, hours offset.

For example

London 	      0
Riga 	      2
Amsterdam     ...
Minsk         ...
Brussels      ...
Kiev          ...
Warsaw        ...
Krakow        ...

If the service does not return a proper response, then display --- instead of 
the number. If there was a network error to access the data, print ERR 
instead.

Design the program in a way that 
-we may use a different service to get the time offset
-we may read the list of cities from another source instead of a file
