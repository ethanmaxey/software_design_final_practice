Using test first development, write a program that will fetch text data from the URL given below, extract relevant details, and print the following:

First part is X

where X is the value before the first dot in the text returned when a request is made to the URL.

If the program runs into an error making the network call, then gracefully display

Error: Y

where Y is the actual error from making the request to the URL.

Follow good design principles to allow for changing the service that will provide the data for the IP Address.
