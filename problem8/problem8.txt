Using test first development, write the program described below.

Write a program that will read a file with the following:
est
cst
mst
pst
pdt
cet
utc

The program should print output in the following format (for example):

code 	Timezone   									Date   					Time
est		Eastern Standard Time       2020-04-29			21:05
...

If there was an error, for example for getting time for pst, that line should 
be displayed like:
pst Error: --reason---
where the --reason-- is details about what went wrong.

Write the program so the service at http://worldclockapi.com/api/json/???/now 
(where ??? can be est, cst, etc.) is used to get the details about the date 
and time.

Design the program in a way that if we decide to use a different service in 
the future, we do not have to change, as much as possible, any existing code, 
but may have to create new pieces of code to integrate with existing code. We 
can assume that any new service we will use will be able to accept the 
timezone 3 letter code to return the date and time.
